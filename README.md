# Covid-19 Simple Analysis Python Notebook

This is a simple Python notebook to analize data about italian Covid-19 plague. The dataset is linked (as a git submodule) to the institutional official data released by the italian *Protezione Civile* [repository](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19.git).

## How it works?

Clone the repository and launch Jupyter:  
`jupyter notebook`  
Then choose the notebook and play!  
You might need some dependancies, you have them in the `environment.yml` file.
